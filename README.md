# FEC_Lighthouse

Welcome to the Pharos of Alexandria FEC project.

# Install Packages

To start up the site, you'll need to do the following

In the terminal, please...

run command: yarn install // this will install all the required dependencies

# Set up API reference

You'll need to create a .env file
It should include the following variables: {

API = [The necessary heroku api reference - be sure it includes a '/' at the end]
GITHUB = [your own github token]
PORT = [whatever port you'd like your local server to listen on]

}

# Start up server

You'll need to run each of these commands in a separate terminal instance

run command: yarn run server-dev
run command: yarn run client-dev
run command: yarn run start

You should then be able to open the site on localhost:[insert port you chose earlier here] in your browser
